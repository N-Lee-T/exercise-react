# OMG Exercise! Basic CRUD app using the MERN stack

This app uses Express as a backend framework and connects with a MongoDB instance via Mongoose. The React frontend allows the user to enter data that fits with the Mongo schema. An attempt was made to give it an '80s feel. 

There are a few things I'd like to fix once I learn a little more about React and Express: 

1. Data validity. Currently, users can enter invalid data. I'd like to figure out a good way to ensure data integrity on the frontend instead of checking data via the server.

2. Complexity on the backend. It would be nice to be able to create different categories and have the ability to save to diffent DB instances.(Is this possible?)
